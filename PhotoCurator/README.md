# 📸 AI Photo Curator

An intelligent photo curation application that uses on-device AI to analyze, organize, and select the best photos from your collection. Built with React Native, TypeScript, and TensorFlow.js for privacy-first, high-performance photo management.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 **Intelligent AI Analysis**
- **On-Device Processing** - All AI analysis happens locally for complete privacy
- **Technical Quality Assessment** - Analyzes sharpness, exposure, and color balance
- **Compositional Analysis** - Evaluates rule of thirds, leading lines, and visual balance
- **Content Recognition** - Detects faces, smiles, and emotional content
- **Visual Similarity** - Groups similar photos and detects duplicates

### 🎯 **Smart Curation**
- **Goal-Based Selection** - Choose from predefined curation goals (Best Shots, Portraits, Scenic)
- **Custom Weighting** - Adjust importance of technical, compositional, and content factors
- **Intelligent Clustering** - Automatically groups photos by time, location, and visual similarity
- **Personalized Learning** - AI improves based on your selection preferences

### 🎨 **Apple-Inspired Design**
- **Fluid Animations** - Smooth 60fps animations using React Native Reanimated
- **Haptic Feedback** - Satisfying tactile responses to user interactions
- **Dark Mode First** - Beautiful dark interface optimized for photo viewing
- **Accessibility** - Full VoiceOver support and Dynamic Type compatibility

### 🔒 **Privacy First**
- **Local Processing** - Photos never leave your device during analysis
- **Optional Cloud Sync** - Sync only metadata and selections, not photos
- **No Tracking** - Zero analytics or user tracking
