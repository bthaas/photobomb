# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Photo Curator is an intelligent mobile application that automatically organizes, curates, and enhances users' photo collections using on-device machine learning. The app helps users manage large photo libraries by identifying the best shots, removing duplicates, organizing photos by events and people, and providing AI-powered editing capabilities. Built with React Native and TypeScript, the app prioritizes user privacy through on-device processing while offering cloud synchronization for cross-device access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to import photos from multiple sources (camera roll, Google Photos, iCloud), so that I can consolidate and organize all my photos in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the import screen THEN the system SHALL display options to import from device camera roll, Google Photos, and iCloud
2. WHEN the user selects a photo source THEN the system SHALL request appropriate permissions and authenticate with the selected service
3. WHEN importing photos THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and allow batch selection
4. WHEN import is complete THEN the system SHALL store photo metadata locally and begin background AI analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a photographer with many similar shots, I want the app to automatically identify and group related photos, so that I can easily find and compare photos from the same event or location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are imported THEN the system SHALL extract image features using on-device TensorFlow.js models
2. WHEN feature extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL group photos using clustering algorithms based on visual similarity, timestamp, and location data
3. WHEN photos are clustered THEN the system SHALL create event groups and display them in the organization view
4. WHEN the user views a cluster THEN the system SHALL show all related photos with the ability to manually adjust groupings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who takes many photos of people, I want the app to recognize and group photos by the people in them, so that I can easily find all photos of specific individuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos contain faces THEN the system SHALL detect faces using on-device facial recognition models
2. WHEN faces are detected THEN the system SHALL create face embeddings and group similar faces together
3. WHEN face groups are created THEN the system SHALL allow users to label people and merge or split face groups
4. WHEN people are labeled THEN the system SHALL enable searching and filtering photos by person

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who wants only the best photos, I want the app to automatically analyze photo quality and suggest the best shots from each group, so that I can quickly identify keepers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are analyzed THEN the system SHALL score each photo based on technical quality (sharpness, exposure, color balance)
2. WHEN quality analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL score photos based on compositional quality (rule of thirds, subject detection)
3. WHEN content analysis runs THEN the system SHALL detect smiles, open eyes, and emotional sentiment
4. WHEN all scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL rank photos within each cluster and suggest top 1-3 candidates
5. WHEN users interact with suggestions THEN the system SHALL learn from user choices to improve future recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who wants different types of photos for different purposes, I want to customize curation goals, so that the app prioritizes the types of photos I value most.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses curation settings THEN the system SHALL display options for different curation goals (Best Scenic, Best Portraits, Most Creative, etc.)
2. WHEN a curation goal is selected THEN the system SHALL adjust the weighting of AI scoring algorithms accordingly
3. WHEN curation preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL re-rank existing photos based on new criteria
4. WHEN viewing curated results THEN the system SHALL indicate which curation goal was used for the selection

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants to improve my photos, I want AI-powered editing tools that can enhance images and remove unwanted elements, so that I can create better-looking photos without manual editing skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a photo for editing THEN the system SHALL provide options for background removal, one-tap enhancement, and smart cropping
2. WHEN background removal is selected THEN the system SHALL use semantic segmentation to create subject masks and remove or blur backgrounds
3. WHEN one-tap enhancement is applied THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust exposure, color balance, and sharpness using predefined algorithms
4. WHEN smart cropping is enabled THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal crop coordinates based on composition analysis
5. WHEN edits are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain original photos and allow reverting changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with multiple devices, I want my curated photo collections to sync across all my devices, so that I can access my organized photos anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates an account THEN the system SHALL provide secure JWT-based authentication
2. WHEN photos are curated locally THEN the system SHALL sync selected photos and metadata to cloud storage (S3 and PostgreSQL)
3. WHEN syncing occurs THEN the system SHALL only upload curated selections to minimize storage costs and sync time
4. WHEN accessing the app on a new device THEN the system SHALL download and display the user's curated collections
5. WHEN conflicts occur during sync THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all AI processing to happen on my device, so that my photos never leave my control during analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis begins THEN the system SHALL perform all machine learning tasks locally using TensorFlow.js
2. WHEN processing photos THEN the system SHALL never send raw image data to external servers for analysis
3. WHEN using cloud sync THEN the system SHALL only upload photos that the user explicitly chooses to sync
4. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL continue to function for all core AI and curation features

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user who processes large photo libraries, I want the app to work efficiently in the background, so that I can continue using my phone while photos are being analyzed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photo analysis begins THEN the system SHALL continue processing in the background when the app is not active
2. WHEN background processing occurs THEN the system SHALL manage battery usage and provide user controls for processing intensity
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user and update the UI with results
4. WHEN the device is under resource pressure THEN the system SHALL pause processing and resume when resources are available

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user who wants a smooth experience, I want the app to have fluid animations and responsive interactions, so that using the app feels natural and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL provide smooth 60fps animations using React Native Reanimated
2. WHEN interacting with photos THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback for key actions
3. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and skeleton screens
4. WHEN gestures are used THEN the system SHALL respond immediately with visual feedback before processing completes
